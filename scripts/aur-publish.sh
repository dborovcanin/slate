# Brings the slate-bin AUR package up to a released version.
#
#   scripts/aur-publish.sh 0.5.0             update the PKGBUILD and push it
#   scripts/aur-publish.sh --no-push 0.5.0   update it and stop, for review
#   scripts/aur-publish.sh --pkgrel 3 0.5.0  force a release number by hand
#
# slate-git is not published here: it is a VCS package that tracks main, so a
# tag has nothing to change in it.
#
# The release number looks after itself. A version the AUR does not have yet
# starts at 1; a version it already has keeps its number when nothing changed,
# and counts up when something did. That counting is not cosmetic: a helper
# decides whether to fetch by comparing version strings, so a corrected
# checksum published under the number everyone already cached is a fix nobody
# can see.
#
# The checksums come from the files themselves rather than from anything typed
# here, so the release has to exist before this runs: slate-bin needs the tag
# archive and the binary the Release workflow uploads. Running it before that
# fails at the download rather than publishing a wrong sum.
#
# The PKGBUILD in the repository is rewritten in place, so what is committed
# here is what the AUR was given. Let the Release workflow run it and commit
# the result after.
